# Lab Enhancement - Principal Components Analysis (PCA)

This lab enhancement explored the application of PCA on the real world dataset. Besides, this lab enhancement also demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of PCA by implementing the dataset with and without PCA to the model and compare the results.

### 1. Real World Dataset

The dataset used in this lab enhancement is the dataset of Weather Climate of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 2023. PCA is applied to the dataset to reduce the dimensionality and allow the data to be visualized in a 2D graph, and hence making it easier to idetify the relationships among the variables.

### 2. Demonstrations of Advantages and Disadvantages

We apply both dataset with and without PCA to train the Linear Regression model and compare the Mean Square Error and the R-Squared for both situations. By comparing both situations, we can conclude the advantages and disadvantages of PCA.
